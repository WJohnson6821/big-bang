# Big Bang Package: Flux Integration

Big Bang uses a continuous deployment tool, [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) to deploy packages using Helm charts sourced from Git ([GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/)).  This document will cover how to integrate a Helm chart, from a mission application or other package, into the Flux pattern required by Big Bang.  Once complete, you will be able to deploy your package with Big Bang.
