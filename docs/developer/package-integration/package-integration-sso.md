# Big Bang Package: Single Sign On (SSO)

Big Bang has configuration for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication using an identity provider, like Keycloak.  If the package supports SSO, you will need to integrate Big Bang's configuration with the package.  If the package does not support SSO, an [authentication service](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/authservice) can be used to intercept traffic and provide SSO.  This document details how to setup your package for either scenario.
